# FFPunters

This repository is created to analyze adding punters into fantasy football.

The idea comes from watching The Pat McAfee Show on youtube who started an office fantasy league. They play a 2 Kicker league, but no punters as they are traditionally not involved in fantasy leagues.

# The Goal

Using the data gathered by nfl_data_py, I will look to find a fantasy scoring system for punters and compare that against Pro Bowl/All Pro data to ensure the best punters are rewarded and a separation is made between top and bottom punters of the league.

Also, make sure that punters are a good fit with other positions in the league to ensure their isn't disparity between position importance.

# Language

I am using python for this discovery process to help improve my personal python skill.
